Task Description:
This task involves evaluating the output of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to determine if it constitutes a hallucination. A hallucination in this context means that the model's output contains information not supported by the provided semantic reference. The task will use the following inputs:

Source (src): This is the context in which a word is used. The word to be defined may or may not be enclosed within special tokens <define> and </define>.

Target (tgt): This is the intended, correct definition of the word, typically sourced from a reference like Wiktionary.

Hypothesis (hyp): This is the actual output produced by the NLP model - the definition it generated for the given word.

ALWAYS ASSUME BOTH THE TARGET AND SOURCE FOR SEMANTIC REFERENCE FOR EVALUATING THE HYPOTHESIS

The task is to assess the hypothesis against the indicated reference (source AND target) to determine if it constitutes a hallucination. The output will be the probability of the hypothesis being a hallucination, represented as a value in the range [0.0, 1.0]. This probability is derived from the consensus of five human annotators, with each increment of 0.2 in the probability representing one annotator's opinion.

Examples:
Input:

'hyp': 'Having a relationship ; connected .'

'tgt': '(slang) An impromptu attempt to ascertain mood, opinions, or attributes.',
Output:

p(Hallucination): 0.4

Input:

'hyp': '(transitive) To make tacky.'

Task Description:
This task involves evaluating the output of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to determine if it constitutes a hallucination. A hallucination in this context means that the model's output contains information not supported by the provided semantic reference. The task will use the following inputs:

Source (src): input passed to be parphrased to NLP model
Target (tgt): This is the intended, correct paraphrased "gold" text
Hypothesis (hyp): This is the actual output produced by the NLP model - the paraphrase it generated for the given word.

The task is to assess the hypothesis against the indicated reference (source AND target) to determine if it constitutes a hallucination.

Examples:

Input:
'src': 'Let me out of here.'
'tgt': 'Someone let me out.'
'hyp': 'Let me leave.'
Output:
p(Hallucination): 0.0

Input:
'src': 'I have a permit.'
'tgt': 'Uh, I'm validated.
'hyp': 'I have a permit to carry it.'
Output:
p(Hallucination): 1.0

Input:
'hyp': "You're gonna leave the talking to me alone."
'src': 'Leave the talking to me.'
'tgt': 'Let me do all the talking.
Output:
p(Hallucination): 0.4

Input:
'hyp': "We don't have the money to risk it, all right?"
'src': "We can't afford to risk it."
'tgt': "We can't risk that."
Output:
p(Hallucination): 0.6

Input:
'hyp': 'It is not impossible.'
'src': 'Nothing is impossible.'
'tgt': 'There's nothing that can't be done.'
Output:
p(Hallucination): 0.2

Input:
'hyp': 'A number between five and eight.'
'src': 'A five, six, seven, eight.'
'tgt': 'And 5, 6, 7, 8.',
Output:
